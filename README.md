# **JurisLens**

*JuriLens* is an information retrieval system capable of extracting and analyzing crime by leveraging IR techniques, including web scraping and data analysis. A user-centric platform that enables seamless access to crime related information and enhances public understanding of the legal landscape.

The objective is to develop an Information Retrieval (IR) system capable of identifying the most relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) based on a user's prompt. The system should consider factors such as semantic similarity, context, and relevance to ensure accurate results. Additionally, it should provide a ranked list of IPC sections based on their relevance to the user's query.
